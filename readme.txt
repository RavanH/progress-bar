a simple progress bar shortcode that can be styled with CSS

== Description ==

This plugin does one thing: it creates a simple (but nice-looking) CSS3 progress bar that you can style with your own CSS and use wherever you want with a simple shortcode.

To add a progress bar to a post or a page, simply use this shortcode:

`[wppb progress=50]`

where \"50\" in the example above is a progress bar that is 50% complete. Â Simple, lightweight, cross-browser compatible (degrades nicely for browsers that don\'t support CSS3).

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
